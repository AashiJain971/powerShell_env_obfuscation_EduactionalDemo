# powerShell_env_obfuscation_EduactionalDemo
 An educational Python script that shows how PowerShell commands can be hidden using characters from environment variables ‚Äî a technique inspired by malware and red team tactics. Designed to help students, blue team defenders, and cybersecurity enthusiasts understand obfuscation at a deeper level.

# üõ°Ô∏è Environment Variable Obfuscation ‚Äì Educational Demo

This mini project is an insightful demo showing how PowerShell commands can be hidden using common Windows environment variables. Inspired by real-world CTFs and red team techniques, it‚Äôs meant purely for **educational and research purposes** ‚Äî no shady business here.

---

##  What's the Goal?

To explore how attackers (or red teamers) might use values already present in the system ‚Äî like environment variables ‚Äî to piece together commands in a stealthy way.  
The aim is to help:

- **Blue teamers**
- **Cybersecurity students**
- **Malware analysts**

‚Ä¶understand how this technique works so they can detect and defend against it.


##  What Does This Script Do?

It takes a simple PowerShell command like:

Write-Output 420

and obfuscate it....
